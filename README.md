# POC lsconverter

A POC converter for [`stashapp/CommunityScripts/chooseYourAdventurePlayer`](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScripts/tree/main/plugins/chooseYourAdventurePlayer) from game.xml files to choice JSON files

## run with node.js
Replace `game.xml` with the applicable file, run `(p)npm install` to install all the dependencies, and then `node convert.js` to conver the filetypes. Some values are hardcoded and need to be changed,

Converting with nodejs with rollup or something similar is on the roadmap.
